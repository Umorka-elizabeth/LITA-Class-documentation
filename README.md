### Project Title: Prudence
### Project Overview
Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution in the exercise of the judgments
needed in making the estimates required under conditions of uncertainty, such
that assets or revenue are not overstated and liabilities or expenses are not
understated. However, the exercise of prudence does not allow, for example, the
creation of hidden reserves or excessive provisions, the deliberate understatement
of assets or revenue, or the deliberate overstatement of liabilities or expenses,
because the financial statements would not be neutral and, therefore, not have
the quality of reliability.
